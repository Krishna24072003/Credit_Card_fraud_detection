Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes transaction details such as the time of the transaction, transaction amount, and anonymized features resulting from PCA dimensionality reduction to protect sensitive information. The target variable indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0).

The project utilizes Random Forest and Logistic Regression classifiers to perform the detection. Key steps include data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data, model training, and evaluation of the models' performance. Additionally, Genetic Algorithms are employed for data augmentation, enhancing the robustness of the models.

The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in improving the detection and prevention of credit card fraud, offering valuable insights for financial institutions and enhancing security measures.
